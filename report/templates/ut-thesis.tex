\begin{document}

%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% You should put all of your `\newcommand', `\newenvironment', and
%% `\newtheorem's (in other words, all the global definitions that
%% you will need throughout your thesis) in a separate file and use
%% "\input{filename}" to input it here.

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
%% ***   Put your Abstract here.   ***
%% (At most 150 words for M.Sc. or 350 words for Ph.D.)
This is the abstract.
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage
%% and the table of contents starts with \clearpage.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
begin{dedication}
To \emph{academia}.
\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% you should put an explicit \newpage between them.

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
\begin{acknowledgements}
Thank you, the reader.
\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
\listoffigures

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page.     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% ***   Include chapter files here.   ***
$body$

%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% ***   Set the bibliography style.   ***
%% (change according to your preference)
% \bibliographystyle{plain}
%% ***   Set the bibliography file.   ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change if needed)
% \bibliography{thesis}

%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file
%% and `\include' or `\input' it here).
